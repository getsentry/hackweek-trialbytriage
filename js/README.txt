Avoid editing any JavaScript code in this directory!

It's best to limit all custom JavaScript code to our plugins. Don't worry, this
doesn't really tie your hands. Any code you see in here that you want to change,
you can override the corresponding manager method from inside a plugin to your
heart's content.
